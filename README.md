## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** → Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric variables  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Study distributions, correlations, and patterns  
3. **Model Building** → Train and compare models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
4. **Model Evaluation** → Evaluate using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score  
5. **Feature Importance Analysis** → Identify which features most influence price predictions

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Carat**, **cut**, and **clarity** are the most significant features affecting price  
- Higher carat diamonds consistently command higher prices  
- Premium cuts tend to have a positive impact on price  
- Depth and table percentages have smaller but noticeable influence
